# Academic Success Classification Project üèÖ
Welcome to my project repository for the Kaggle competition on predicting academic success. This project involves building a classification model to predict student success based on various demographic and academic factors.

Project Overview:
**Objective: To classify students' academic success using machine learning techniques.
Dataset: Provided by Kaggle, containing features such as student demographics, prior academic performance, and socio-economic factors.
Approach: Utilized data preprocessing, feature selection, and multiple classification algorithms to develop an accurate predictive model.
Results: Achieved a top 200 ranking in the competition, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in predicting academic outcomes.**
This project showcases my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and model optimization, contributing to better educational insights.
